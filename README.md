# Pestilence
42 School project. From the subject (also available in french):

> Thanks to the Famine subject, you know what self-replicating programming means. You also know the subject difficulty to obtain a little "virus" useless in an updated system.
> We are going to make this virus running method more complex bringing programming methods that you were not necessarily introduced to during your school years.
> Your little Famine program is about to be upgraded. You will quickly understand that if you want to validate this project, youâ€™re going to have to make radical changes in your source code. When Famine just needed you to discreetly patch a binary, Pestilence will require a way more discreet binary forcing you to apply a "simple" obfuscation strategy within your code... when we say simple, keep in mind this is a very subjective matter...
